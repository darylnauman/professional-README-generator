## Description
The focus of this homework assignment for the University of Toronto SCS Coding Boot Camp was to allow the user to quickly and easily create a README file using a command-line application. This application uses Node.js to dynamically create one. Limited starter code was provided.

## Key Features
- Inquirer package available from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) allows for the command line prompts and user responses to be captured
- Prompts have different ways of capturing the user responses, for example, some questions will have the user type in a response while another will have them select a response from a list of options provided
- File system module from Node.js is used to create and write to a file
- README file created includes a license badge, a table of contents, sections, and contact information for the creator
- Content of the README file follows a structure and includes content that is dynamically populated based on the user responses
- Shields IO is used to create different badges based on the license the user selects for their application

## Walkthrough Video
